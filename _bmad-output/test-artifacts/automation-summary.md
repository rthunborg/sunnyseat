# Automation Expansion Summary — Story 10.1 (Cloud-Gated Sun State & Weather-Truth Fixes)

## Preflight & Context
- **Framework:** Vitest 4.1.4 (`nextjs-app/vitest.config.ts`) + Playwright present. Verified — no HALT.
- **Stack:** fullstack (Next.js frontend + server-only sun engine). Story 10.1 is the ENGINE half of Epic 10 — server-only, env-gated (`SUNNYSEAT_SUN_ENGINE=real`), zero UI. All targets are unit-level engine surfaces; no e2e (that is Story 10.5).
- **Mode:** BMad-Integrated (story with AC1–AC4 + rich Dev Notes / Test Surfaces). Sequential generation (single cohesive engine surface).

## Existing coverage reviewed (to avoid duplication)
The four AC-driven ATDD scaffolds + two supporting suites already prove all four ACs on their headline paths:
- `sun-engine.cloud-gate.atdd.test.ts` — `applyCloudGate` (Sunny/Partial-above ⇒ gated, NoSun/Shaded untouched, unknown/null no-gate, exact `>=` boundary), end-to-end gate + geometric-layer preservation, cache consistency.
- `met-no-service.cloud-gate.atdd.test.ts` — missing `cloud_area_fraction` ⇒ unknown, never 0/100/clear; known-cloud path preserved.
- `confidence-calculator.cloud-gate.atdd.test.ts` + `confidence-calculator.test.ts` — FR12 cloud sensitivity, **monotonicity across [0,25,50,75,100]**, unknown-neutral, byte-identical no-weather pin. Assessed as comprehensive — NOT expanded.
- `venues-route.cloud-gate.atdd.test.ts` + `venues-route-real-engine.test.ts` — sanitizer round-trip + `SUN_STATUS_ORDER` sort-rank invariant (no NaN), CloudObscured sorts between Partial and Shaded through the route.

## Gaps Identified & Filled
New file: **`nextjs-app/test/unit/services/sun-engine.cloud-gate.coverage.test.ts`** (9 tests). Residual branch/edge gaps the scaffolds intentionally left, no duplication:

| # | Gap | Priority |
| - | --- | -------- |
| 1 | `skyConditionFromCloudCover(undefined)` ⇒ `'unavailable'` — AC2 unknown branch of the pure mapper (existing pure-mapper test only covers 0..100 numeric boundaries; `undefined` never asserted). Also pins that `undefined` ≠ known `0`. | P1 |
| 2 | `applyCloudGate` idempotency — `CloudObscured` in ⇒ stays `CloudObscured` under overcast, below-threshold, and unknown (helper documents "already gated stays gated" but ATDD never re-feeds it). | P2 |
| 3 | `applyCloudGate` Partial-below-threshold stays `Partial` (ATDD only drove the Sunny-below case). | P2 |
| 4 | `applyCloudGate` defensive out-of-range cover: `>100` still gates (`>=` semantics), `<0` does not, no throw. | P3 |
| 5 | End-to-end FORECAST gating — overcast `isForecast:true` slice gates to `CloudObscured` (geometric layer preserved); clear forecast does not gate. Pins the Story-10.4 seam per Dev Notes ("Gating on forecast cloud is correct and intended… do not special-case forecast here"). Injected via `getForecastOverride` — the documented seam, no live Met.no. | P1 |

Mock boundary mirrors the ATDD scaffold (deepest adapters only). Threshold assertions read `CLOUD_GATE_THRESHOLD_PERCENT` so a re-tune cannot break them (epic-10 test-design "assert relative behaviour" discipline).

## Validation / Gate
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → **0 errors**
- `npx eslint <new file>` → **0 errors**
- `npx vitest run` → **112 files / 993 tests, all passing, 0 skipped** (story HEAD was 111 files / 984 tests → net **+1 file / +9 tests**, none dropped, none regressed).
- Default seed path (flag OFF, as CI runs it) untouched — no CI-path change; test-only addition.
- (`Not implemented: navigation to another Document` in vitest output is a benign pre-existing jsdom log, not a failure.)
