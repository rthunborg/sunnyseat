## Deployment Strategy

### Zero-Downtime Deployment Approach

**Blue-Green Deployment:**

1. Deploy new version to "green" environment
2. Run validation tests on green environment
3. Switch traffic from "blue" to "green"
4. Monitor for issues
5. Keep blue environment as rollback option
6. Decommission blue after stability confirmed

**Database Migration Strategy:**

- Backward-compatible migrations only
- Test migrations in staging first
- Create backup before migration
- Rollback plan for each migration
- Monitor migration performance

**Cache Management:**

- Warm cache before traffic switch
- Gradual cache invalidation
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Fallback to database if cache fails

## Operational Excellence

### Monitoring & Observability

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**

- API availability and uptime (target: 99.9%)
- Response time p50, p95, p99
- Error rate (target: <1%)
- Cache hit rate (target: >85%)
- Database query performance
- Weather API integration health
- User feedback and accuracy metrics

**Alerting Strategy:**

- Critical alerts: Page on-call immediately
- Warning alerts: Create ticket for investigation
- Informational alerts: Log for analysis
- Alert fatigue prevention: Tuned thresholds
- Escalation paths defined

### Security Operations

**Security Monitoring:**

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API access patterns
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SSL certificate expiration
- Key Vault access auditing

**Incident Response:**

- Security incident severity definitions
- Breach notification procedures
- Forensic data collection
- Communication templates
- Legal/compliance requirements

### Performance Management

**Performance Baselines:**

- API response times under various loads
- Database query performance benchmarks
- Frontend load time targets
- Map rendering performance
- Sun calculation throughput

**Performance Degradation Response:**

1. Identify degradation cause
2. Determine impact on users
3. Implement temporary mitigation
4. Plan permanent fix
5. Validate resolution

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

**Database Backups:**

- Automated daily backups (7-day retention)
- Weekly backups (30-day retention)
- Monthly backups (12-month retention)
- Backup integrity verification
- Restore testing quarterly

**Configuration Backups:**

- Infrastructure as Code in version control
- Key Vault secret versioning
- Container image versioning
- Configuration file versioning

**Recovery Procedures:**

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 4 hours
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 1 hour
- Documented recovery steps
- Tested recovery procedures
- Emergency contact list

### Business Continuity

**Failover Scenarios:**

- Azure region outage
- Database failure
- API service failure
- CDN failure
- Third-party service outage

**Degraded Mode Operation:**

- Serve cached data if weather API unavailable
- Display estimated confidence when data incomplete
