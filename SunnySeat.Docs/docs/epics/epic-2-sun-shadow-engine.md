## Epic Goal

Develop and implement the core sun/shadow calculation engine that determines patio sun exposure throughout the day, providing the fundamental capability that differentiates SunnySeat from basic venue discovery apps.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**
Building on the foundation from Epic 1, this epic implements the sophisticated solar geometry and shadow modeling algorithms that power SunnySeat's core value proposition: accurate, real-time sun exposure predictions for specific patio locations.

**What This Epic Delivers:**

- 2.5D shadow modeling using building geometries and patio polygons
- Real-time sun exposure calculation API endpoints
- Precomputation pipeline with intelligent caching
- Performance-optimized spatial queries for sun calculations

**Technical Architecture Alignment:**

- Implements algorithms specified in `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/algorithms.md`
- Uses spatial data model from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/data-model-postgresql-postgis.md`
- Follows performance requirements from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/performance-scaling.md`
- Integrates with API design from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/api-design.md`
