## Technical Implementation

**Frontend Architecture:**

- React 18 with TypeScript (strict mode)
- MapLibre GL JS for interactive mapping
- TanStack Query for server state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design system
- Vite for build tooling and development server

**Component Structure:**

```
