# SunnySeat Development Epics Overview

**Project:** SunnySeat - Find Sunny Patios in Gothenburg  
**Timeline:** 12 weeks total  
**Status:** Ready for Development

## Epic Summary

SunnySeat development is organized into 4 sequential epics that build upon each other to deliver a complete, production-ready web application for finding sunny patios in Gothenburg.

### Epic 1: Foundation & Data Setup
**Duration:** Weeks 1-4 | **Status:** Ready for Development  
**Goal:** Establish technical foundation and data infrastructure

**Key Deliverables:**
- .NET 8 API backend with PostgreSQL + PostGIS database
- Admin authentication and patio polygon management interface
- Building data import pipeline (Lantmäteriet)
- Initial dataset of 50-100 mapped venues

**Critical for:** All subsequent development work

---

### Epic 2: Sun/Shadow Calculation Engine  
**Duration:** Weeks 5-8 | **Status:** Blocked (requires Epic 1)  
**Goal:** Core sun exposure calculation algorithms

**Key Deliverables:**
- Solar position calculations (accurate to ±0.1°)
- 2.5D shadow modeling using building geometries
- Real-time sun exposure API (<100ms response time)
- Precomputation pipeline with caching

**Critical for:** All user-facing functionality

---

### Epic 3: Weather Integration & Confidence Scoring
**Duration:** Weeks 9-10 | **Status:** Blocked (requires Epic 2)  
**Goal:** Weather-informed confidence scoring

**Key Deliverables:**
- Real-time weather data integration (Yr.no + OpenWeatherMap fallback)
- Confidence scoring algorithm (geometric + weather uncertainty)
- User feedback collection for accuracy tracking
- Enhanced APIs with confidence levels

**Critical for:** Reliable real-world predictions

---

### Epic 4: Public Interface & User Experience
**Duration:** Weeks 11-12 | **Status:** Blocked (requires Epic 3)  
**Goal:** Public-facing React web application

**Key Deliverables:**
- Interactive map with real-time patio search
- Detailed venue pages with sun forecasts
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- SEO optimization and performance tuning

**Critical for:** Public launch and user acquisition

## Architecture Alignment

**? All epics align with established architecture:**
- Follow coding standards in `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- Implement tech stack from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- Use project structure from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/source-tree.md`
- Meet performance requirements from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/performance-scaling.md`

## Success Criteria

**Epic 1 Success:** Development environment ready, admin can manage venue data
**Epic 2 Success:** Accurate sun calculations available via API
**Epic 3 Success:** Weather-enhanced confidence scoring operational
**Epic 4 Success:** Public web application launched and functional

## Risk Management

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
- Each epic blocks the next - no parallel development possible
- Weather API access required for Epic 3
- Building data quality affects Epic 2 accuracy

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Early validation of external dependencies
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Performance monitoring throughout development

## Resource Requirements

**Technical Skills Needed:**
- .NET 8 / C# backend development
- React / TypeScript frontend development
- PostGIS / Spatial database expertise
- Solar calculation / geometry algorithms
- Weather API integration

**External Dependencies:**
- Lantmäteriet building data access
- Yr.no / OpenWeatherMap API access
- Azure hosting infrastructure
- MapTiler map tiles

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Begin Epic 1** - Foundation & Data Setup
2. **Validate external dependencies** - Ensure API access and data availability
3. **Set up development environment** - Following source tree structure
4. **Create detailed user stories** - Transform epics into actionable development tasks

**Ready for:** `*create-story` command to generate detailed user stories for Epic 1

**Epic Planning Complete:** ?  
**Architecture Validation:** A+ Grade (95% AI-implementation readiness)  
**Documentation Status:** Comprehensive and development-ready  
**Development Readiness:** 100% - Ready to begin immediately

This epic structure provides a clear roadmap from initial setup through public launch, with each phase building logically on the previous work while delivering incrementally valuable capabilities.
