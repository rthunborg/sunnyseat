# Epic 1: Foundation & Data Setup

**Duration:** Weeks 1-4  
**Priority:** Critical Path  
**Status:** Ready for Development

## Epic Goal

Establish the core technical foundation and data infrastructure for SunnySeat, enabling secure data storage, admin management, and the essential building/venue data needed for sun calculations.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**
SunnySeat is a greenfield React + .NET 8 web application that helps users find sunny patios in Gothenburg. This epic establishes the foundational infrastructure without which no other features can function.

**What This Epic Delivers:**
- Complete technical foundation (backend API, database, admin authentication)
- Data pipeline for importing and processing Gothenburg building/venue data
- Admin interface for managing patio polygon data
- Initial dataset of 50-100 venues with patio polygons ready for sun calculations

**Technical Architecture Alignment:**
- Implements the .NET 8 Minimal API backend specified in `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/api-design.md`
- Sets up PostgreSQL + PostGIS database per `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/data-model-postgresql-postgis.md`
- Follows coding standards defined in `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- Uses project structure from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/source-tree.md`

## Stories Breakdown

### Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup
**Goal:** Complete technical project setup with development-ready infrastructure

**Key Deliverables:**
- .NET 8 API project with minimal API structure
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS database with connection and migration framework
- Docker development environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline foundation (GitHub Actions)
- Basic health checks and monitoring setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API responds to health check endpoint
- Database migrations can be run successfully
- Local development environment starts with `docker-compose up`
- All architecture compliance checks pass
- Build pipeline runs automated tests

### Story 1.2: Building Data Import Pipeline
**Goal:** Import and process Gothenburg building data for sun calculations

**Key Deliverables:**
- Lantmäteriet .gpkg import pipeline
- Building geometry validation and processing
- Data quality scoring and validation system
- Building data API endpoints for admin use

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Successfully imports building data from Lantmäteriet .gpkg files
- Validates building geometries and flags quality issues
- Stores building data in PostGIS with proper spatial indexes
- Provides API endpoints for admin to query building data
- Performance: Import process completes within 30 minutes for Gothenburg dataset

### Story 1.3: Admin Authentication & Security
**Goal:** Secure admin access for managing venue and patio data

**Key Deliverables:**
- JWT-based admin authentication system
- Role-based access control for admin endpoints
- Secure credential management
- Rate limiting and security middleware

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can authenticate with secure credentials
- JWT tokens have appropriate expiration and refresh logic
- Admin endpoints are protected and inaccessible without authentication
- Security middleware prevents common attacks (rate limiting, CORS, etc.)
- Authentication follows security standards in `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/security-privacy.md`

### Story 1.4: Admin Polygon Editor Interface
**Goal:** Admin interface for creating and managing patio polygon data

**Key Deliverables:**
- React admin SPA with map-based polygon editor
- Create, edit, save, and delete patio polygons
- Import/export functionality (GeoJSON, GeoPackage)
- Metadata management (height, orientation, quality flags)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can draw and edit patio polygons on an interactive map
- Polygon editor supports snap, undo/redo functionality
- Can import GeoPackage/GeoJSON files for bulk polygon creation
- Metadata can be set per patio (height_source, polygon_quality, review_needed)
- Interface is responsive and works on tablet devices for field use

### Story 1.5: Venue Data Seeding & Validation
**Goal:** Initial dataset of mapped venues ready for sun calculation development

**Key Deliverables:**
- Database of 50-100 Gothenburg venues with patio polygons
- Data quality validation and audit system
- Venue management API endpoints
- Data export capabilities for development/testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database contains at least 50 venues with high-quality patio polygons
- Each venue has complete metadata (name, address, patio geometry)
- Data quality validation identifies and flags potential issues
- Admin can audit unmapped venues and add new ones easily
- Data can be exported for use in development and testing environments

## Technical Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Lantmäteriet building data (.gpkg format)
- PostgreSQL 15 + PostGIS 3.4
- Azure hosting infrastructure
- GitHub for source control and CI/CD

**Internal Dependencies:**
- None (this is the foundation epic)

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ? Follows coding standards in `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- ? Implements tech stack from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- ? Uses project structure from `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/source-tree.md`
- ? Aligns with security requirements in `SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/security-privacy.md`

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risks:**
1. **Lantmäteriet Data Format Changes** ? Mitigation: Build flexible import pipeline with format validation
2. **PostGIS Performance Issues** ? Mitigation: Implement spatial indexing and query optimization from start
3. **Admin Interface Complexity** ? Mitigation: Start with MVP polygon editor, iterate based on admin feedback

**Rollback Plan:**
- All database changes use reversible migrations
- Feature flags for admin interface components
- Dockerized environment enables quick environment restoration

## Definition of Done

**Epic Complete When:**
- [ ] All 5 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Full test coverage for all API endpoints and data pipelines
- [ ] Admin can successfully import building data and create patio polygons
- [ ] Database contains 50+ venues ready for sun calculation development
- [ ] All architecture compliance requirements satisfied
- [ ] Security audit passes for admin authentication system
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for data import and polygon operations
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup and admin procedures

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
