## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree Information:**

- Weather processing services in `src/backend/SunnySeat.Core/Services/`
- Weather data models in `src/backend/SunnySeat.Core/Entities/`
- Processing interfaces in `src/backend/SunnySeat.Core/Interfaces/`
- Database configurations in `src/backend/SunnySeat.Data/Configurations/`
- Weather processing will be called from the ingestion pipeline created in Story 3.1

**Integration Points:**

- Depends on Story 3.1 weather data ingestion pipeline
- Integrates with existing Redis caching infrastructure
- Feeds processed data to Story 3.3 confidence scoring algorithm
- Uses existing patio location data from venue management system
- Connects with existing spatial query patterns used in shadow calculations

**Technical Architecture Notes:**

- Follow existing processing service patterns (see `SunExposureService.cs`)
- Use same async/await patterns as existing services
- Leverage existing spatial utility classes from shadow calculations
- Implement processing as a background service similar to precomputation pipeline
- Use existing monitoring and logging patterns

**Weather Processing Requirements:**

- Cloud cover normalization: 0-100% scale regardless of source
- Precipitation threshold: >20% probability or >0.1mm/hour intensity blocks sun
- Spatial resolution: Interpolate 1km grid data to individual patio coordinates
- Temporal alignment: Align 5-minute and hourly data to common timeline
- Processing performance: <30 seconds from ingestion to processed data availability

**Key Algorithms:**

- Bilinear interpolation for spatial weather estimation
- Temporal interpolation for aligning different data source frequencies
- Weather condition categorization: Clear (<20% cloud), Partly Cloudy (20-70%), Cloudy (>70%)
- Sun-blocking logic: Precipitation OR cloud cover >80% OR visibility <5km

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**

- Test files location: `src/backend/SunnySeat.Core.Tests/Services/`
- Use xUnit testing framework (consistent with existing tests)
- Follow existing testing patterns for spatial calculations (see `ShadowGeometryTests.cs`)
- Mock weather data with known spatial/temporal patterns
- Include performance tests for processing latency requirements
- Test coverage requirements: >80% for processing service classes

**Specific Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for cloud cover extraction and normalization
- Tests for spatial interpolation accuracy with known data points
- Performance tests ensuring <30 second processing requirement
- Integration tests with actual weather data samples
- Tests for edge cases (missing data, boundary conditions)
- Validation tests for weather condition categorization accuracy

**Recommendations:**

- Consider rate limiting on weather API endpoints to prevent abuse (future enhancement)
- Add request size limits to prevent large payload attacks (future enhancement)
