## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

This story implements the building data foundation specified in the architecture, providing the essential geometry data for shadow calculations described in Epic 2.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- PostgreSQL + PostGIS database infrastructure is operational
- Entity Framework migrations framework is established
- Docker development environment includes all necessary tools
- CI/CD pipeline can handle database-dependent tests

### Data Models

**Building Table Schema** [Source: SunnySeat.Docs/docs/import-pipeline-guide.md]:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Buildings (
    Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Polygon geometry(Polygon,4326) NOT NULL,
    HeightM DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    Source VARCHAR(50),
    Floors INTEGER,
    BuildingType VARCHAR(100),
    SourceId VARCHAR(100),
    SourceCrs VARCHAR(20),
    CreatedAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    UpdatedAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- Spatial index for efficient queries
CREATE INDEX IX_Buildings_Polygon_Spatial ON Buildings USING GIST (Polygon);
```

**Height Estimation Logic** [Source: SunnySeat.Docs/docs/import-pipeline-guide.md]:

- Floor Count Available: `height = floors � 3.5m`
- No Floor Data: Default minimum height of 6.0m (~2 floors)
- Source Tracking: Heights marked as `floor_heuristic` or `default_heuristic`

### API Specifications

**Building Admin Endpoints** [Source: SunnySeat.Docs/docs/import-pipeline-guide.md]:

- Console command: `SunnySeat.exe import-buildings "path/to/buildings.gpkg"`
- Programmatic API: `IBuildingImportService.ImportFromGpkgAsync()`
- Validation API: `ValidateGpkgFileAsync()` for file structure verification
- Admin endpoints for building queries and statistics

### Tech Stack Implementation

**GDAL Integration** [Source: SunnySeat.Docs/docs/architecture/tooling-import.md, SunnySeat.Docs/docs/import-pipeline-guide.md]:

- GDAL/ogr2ogr for .gpkg file processing

- NetTopologySuite for spatial data handling in .NET
- Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL spatial provider

**Dependencies Required**:

- Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
