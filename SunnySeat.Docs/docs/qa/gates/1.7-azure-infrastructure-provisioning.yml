gate: PASS
status_reason: "Excellent IaC implementation with comprehensive documentation and appropriate security/scaling design. Story scope clarified - Front Door CDN and WAF deferred to Story 4.5 (Performance & SEO) as post-MVP enhancements. Core infrastructure is deployment-ready for MVP."

  recommendations:

    monitor:
      - "Database firewall rule allows all Azure services (0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0) - consider restricting to specific subnet"
      - "VNet address space (10.0.0.0/16) adequate for MVP but may need expansion for scale"
      - "No disaster recovery runbook yet (acceptable for MVP, needed for production)"

# Positive findings
strengths:
  - "Comprehensive Bicep IaC with 11 modular templates (1,711 lines compiled ARM JSON)"
  - "Exceptional documentation - 4 operational guides totaling ~1,676 lines"
  - "Security-first design: Managed identities, Key Vault, VNet isolation, RBAC"
  - "Environment-specific parameterization with appropriate SKU sizing"
  - "Cost-conscious architecture ($80 dev → $695 prod/month)"
  - "Automated secret generation in deployment scripts"
  - "Template validation passing (az bicep build + linter)"
  - "Professional-grade operational guides for deployment, secrets, architecture"

# Acceptance criteria status (31 total, MVP scope)

  - "Azure Front Door configured for CDN (Post-MVP - Story 4.5)"
  - "WAF configured (Post-MVP - Story 4.5 with Front Door)"
  - "Application deploys to Azure (requires Story 1.6 Docker image)"

# Testing performed
testing:
  validation_completed:
    - "Bicep template compilation to ARM JSON"
    - "Linter validation (warnings only, no errors)"
    - "All 10 modules build successfully"
    - "Parameter file structure validation"

    - "Actual Azure deployment (requires user execution)"
    - "Resource connectivity validation (database → Container Apps)"
    - "Secret retrieval from Key Vault"
    - "Application deployment to Container Apps (requires Story 1.6 Docker image)"

# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  This story delivers EXCELLENT Infrastructure as Code work with comprehensive Bicep templates,
  professional operational documentation, and appropriate security/scaling design.
  
  SCOPE CLARIFICATION APPLIED (Option B):
  - Azure Front Door CDN and WAF moved to Story 4.5 (Performance Optimization & SEO)
  - GitHub Actions workflow clarified as PowerShell automation scripts
  - Production cost adjusted to ~$700/month (Front Door to be added in Story 4.5)
  - Template structure diagram updated to remove frontdoor.bicep reference
  
  The infrastructure is deployment-ready with:
  - 11 modular Bicep templates validated and compiled to ARM JSON
  - Comprehensive security: Managed identities, Key Vault, VNet isolation, RBAC
  - Environment-specific parameterization (dev/staging/prod)
  - Professional documentation (4 guides, ~1,676 lines)
  - Automated deployment scripts with secret generation
  
  GATE STATUS: PASS because:
  - All MVP-scoped acceptance criteria met (28/31)
  - Core infrastructure complete and validated
  - Post-MVP features appropriately deferred to Story 4.5
  - Does not block development or staging deployment
  - Security posture is strong
  - Documentation is exceptional
  
  READY FOR: Deployment to Azure and integration with Story 1.6 (CI/CD)
