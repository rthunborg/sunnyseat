top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Production JWT secret key is a demo value in appsettings.json that must not be deployed to production"
    suggested_action: "MANDATORY: Implement Azure Key Vault integration and remove demo secret before production deployment"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Unit tests exist but test discovery is failing (13 tests in AuthenticationServiceTests.cs not being discovered)"
    suggested_action: "Investigate test project configuration and xUnit setup to enable automated test execution in CI/CD"

  - id: "SCALE-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Rate limiting uses in-memory cache which won't scale across multiple instances"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Remove demo JWT secret from appsettings.json before any production deployment"
