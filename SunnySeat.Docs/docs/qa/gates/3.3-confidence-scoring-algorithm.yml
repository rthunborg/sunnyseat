# Review notes
notes: |
  This implementation demonstrates exceptional software craftsmanship. The confidence 
  scoring algorithm is mathematically sound, well-tested, and production-ready. The dev 
  team has delivered outstanding work with:
  
  - All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated
  - 36 comprehensive tests with >90% coverage
  - Zero technical debt introduced
  - Backward compatibility maintained
  - Excellent integration with existing services
  - Clear, maintainable code following all standards
  
  No changes required - this story is immediately production-ready and can proceed 
  directly to Done status. This is exemplary work that other stories should aspire to.
