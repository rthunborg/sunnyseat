nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JWT authentication enforced, authorization working, input validation prevents injection, spatial data validation prevents manipulation. Verified through 401 tests and integration testing."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bulk seeding ~200-300ms for 53 venues, venue retrieval ~130-170ms, search ~140ms. Slightly over baselines but acceptable for MVP. PostGIS indexes properly configured."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling tested, database transactions ensure consistency, duplicate detection prevents corruption. Demonstrated through integration test suite."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent architectural layering, comprehensive documentation, follows coding standards, well-organized test structure."
