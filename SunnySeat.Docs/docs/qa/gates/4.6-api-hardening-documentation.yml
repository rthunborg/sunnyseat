# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent security posture with defense in depth:
      - Rate limiting prevents abuse (AspNetCoreRateLimit v5.0.0)
      - CORS properly configured (no wildcards, environment-specific)
      - Security headers protect against XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing
      - HSTS enforces HTTPS in production
      - Content Security Policy restricts resource loading
      - No sensitive data exposure in error responses
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Well optimized with minimal overhead:
      - Rate limiting: <1ms per request (memory cache)
      - CORS preflight caching: MaxAge 3600s
      - Response compression: Brotli/Gzip configured
      - Total middleware overhead: <5ms (acceptable)
      - Distributed cache ready (Redis for production)
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Robust error handling and resource protection:
      - Rate limiting prevents resource exhaustion
      - Graceful 429 responses with Retry-After headers
      - Configurable limits (no code changes required)
      - Distributed cache support for scaling
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent code organization and documentation:
      - Clear separation of concerns (middleware classes)
      - Environment-specific configuration (dev vs production)
      - Comprehensive XML documentation on all endpoints
      - OpenAPI spec enables automated client generation
      - Follows established .NET patterns and coding standards
