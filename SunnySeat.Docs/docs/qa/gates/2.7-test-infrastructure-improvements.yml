notes: |
  Exemplary test infrastructure work that demonstrates:
  - Systematic problem-solving and root cause analysis
  - Production-grade decision-making (.NET 8 LTS migration)
  - Comprehensive documentation for future maintainability
  - Proper balance between test infrastructure and production stability
  
  This story serves as a reference implementation for test infrastructure improvements.
