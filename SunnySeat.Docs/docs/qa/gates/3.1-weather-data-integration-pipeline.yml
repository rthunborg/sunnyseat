acknowledgments: |
  Excellent work by the development team resolving all blocking security and compliance
  violations within 24 hours of the initial FAIL gate. The comprehensive 754-line
  operational documentation exceeds requirements and demonstrates strong commitment
  to production readiness. The User-Agent header bug discovered during this review
  was promptly fixed, showcasing the value of thorough QA validation.

  This story moves from FAIL to PASS - a testament to responsive engineering,
  security awareness, and dedication to quality standards.

    - "Risk score >= 9 (security=9) → Gate = FAIL (auto-escalation)"
    - "Issue severity = CRITICAL (SECURITY-001) → Gate = FAIL"
