    status: PASS
    notes: "Read-only shadow calculations, no auth concerns. API layer adds input validation, UTC datetime handling, batch size limits."

    notes: "Clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, follows coding standards throughout both service and API layers. Zero technical debt."

technical_strengths:
  - "Sophisticated 2.5D geometric algorithms with sound mathematical foundations"
  - "Excellent service layer architecture with clear separation of concerns"
  - "Robust edge case handling (low sun angles, buildings below horizon, geometry errors)"
  - "Strong integration with Story 2.1 (Solar) and Epic 1 (Building Data)"
  - "30 passing unit tests covering core shadow geometry calculations"
  - "Proper use of NetTopologySuite for spatial operations"

  immediate:
    - action: "Clarify API endpoint implementation status - create endpoints or update story scope"
      refs: ["Story 2.2 Task 4", "File List API Layer section"]
    - action: "Add performance benchmarks or explicitly waive AC #3"
      refs: ["AC #3", "Performance Requirements section"]

  future:
    - action: "Implement shadow caching strategy (designed but not implemented)"
      refs: ["ShadowCacheService mentioned in Dev Notes"]
    - action: "Add comprehensive integration tests for full shadow calculation workflows"
      refs: ["Testing section"]
    - action: "Consider implementing admin endpoints for building height overrides"
      refs: ["BuildingHeightManager design includes admin overrides"]

implementation_notes: |
  Core shadow modeling functionality is solid and production-ready at the service layer.
  The ShadowCalculationService is successfully used by Story 2.3's SunExposureService,
  demonstrating functional integration. The issue is not code quality but documentation
  accuracy - the story claims API endpoints were created when they don't exist.

  Decision Point: Does Story 2.2 need standalone shadow API endpoints, or is it
  acceptable for shadows to be accessed only via the Sun Exposure API in Story 2.3?
  Both are valid architectures, but the story should accurately reflect the choice.
