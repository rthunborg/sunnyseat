# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper input validation, no SQL injection risks, appropriate error sanitization, no sensitive data exposure"
    
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Core calculation <50ms (well under 200ms target), efficient async patterns, caching deferred to Story 2.4"
