## Detailed Risk Analysis

### PERF-001: Spatial Query Performance
**Category:** Performance  
**Risk Score:** 2 (Low Probability  Medium Impact)

**Description:**  
Spatial queries on ProcessedWeather table could become slow as data volume grows, especially for patio-specific weather lookups across large time ranges.

**Affected Components:**
- WeatherRepository.GetProcessedWeatherAsync()
- Database spatial indexes (GIST)

**Probability:** Low (1)  
- Database properly indexed with GIST spatial index on Location
- Temporal indexes on Timestamp reduce query scope
- Performance tests validate acceptable performance

**Impact:** Medium (2)  
- Slow queries could delay sun predictions
- User experience degradation if weather data loading is slow

**Mitigation Strategy:**
 **Implemented:**
- GIST spatial index on ProcessedWeather.Location
- Composite index on (Timestamp, IsSunBlocking)
- Query optimization in repository methods
- Performance test validates <50ms query time

**Residual Risk:** Minimal  
**Owner:** dev  
**Timeline:** Addressed in current implementation

### DATA-001: Weather API Data Quality
**Category:** Data  
**Risk Score:** 2 (Low Probability  Medium Impact)

**Description:**  
Weather API sources (Met.no, OpenWeatherMap) may provide inconsistent, missing, or inaccurate data that affects sun predictions.

**Affected Components:**
- WeatherProcessingService.ProcessWeatherDataAsync()
- Weather data normalization logic

**Probability:** Low (1)  
- Both APIs are mature and reliable
- Normalization logic handles variations
- Clamping ensures data stays in valid ranges

**Impact:** Medium (2)  
- Inaccurate weather data leads to wrong sun predictions
- User trust degradation

**Mitigation Strategy:**
 **Implemented:**
- Input validation with range clamping (0-100%)
- Source-aware normalization logic
- Confidence level calculation based on data source and age
- Fallback to nearest neighbor when data is sparse

**Testing Requirements:**
 Completed:
- Unit tests for normalization edge cases
- Boundary condition tests (negative, >100% cloud cover)
- Multi-source consistency tests

**Residual Risk:** Low - Acceptable for MVP  
**Owner:** dev  
**Timeline:** Monitoring in production will identify data quality issues

### TECH-001: Integration with Story 3.1
**Category:** Technical  
**Risk Score:** 1 (Low Probability  Low Impact)

**Description:**  
Weather processing depends on Story 3.1 (ingestion pipeline) to provide raw weather data. Integration issues could break the processing flow.

**Affected Components:**
- WeatherIngestionService (Story 3.1)
- WeatherProcessingService (Story 3.2)
- WeatherSlice entity handoff

**Probability:** Low (1)  
- Both stories completed by same developer
- Clear interface contracts (WeatherSlice entity)
- Integration already documented in Dev Notes

**Impact:** Low (1)  
- Processing cannot run without ingestion
- Issue would be caught immediately in testing

**Mitigation Strategy:**
 **Implemented:**
- Clear entity contracts (WeatherSlice)
- Repository pattern decouples services
- Integration tests verify data flow

**Residual Risk:** Minimal  
**Owner:** dev  
**Timeline:** Complete

### OPS-001: Processing Latency Monitoring
**Category:** Operational  
**Risk Score:** 4 (Medium Probability  Medium Impact)

**Description:**  
Without proper monitoring, processing latency issues (>30 seconds) may not be detected until they impact users.

**Affected Components:**
- WeatherIngestionService processing pipeline
- Background processing workers

**Probability:** Medium (2)  
- Processing latency can degrade over time with data growth
- No automated alerting configured yet

**Impact:** Medium (2)  
- Stale weather data affects sun prediction accuracy
- User experience degradation

**Mitigation Strategy:**
 **Partially Implemented:**
- Performance test validates <30 second requirement
- Logging of processing latency in service

**Recommendations:**
- Add Application Insights custom metrics for processing time
- Create alert when processing >25 seconds (buffer before 30s limit)
- Dashboard for processing latency trends

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Monitoring needed in production  
**Owner:** ops  
**Timeline:** Before production deployment (2 hours)

### TECH-002: Spatial Interpolation Accuracy
**Category:** Technical  
**Risk Score:** 1 (Low Probability  Low Impact)

**Description:**  
Bilinear interpolation may not accurately represent weather patterns, especially for fast-moving weather fronts.

**Affected Components:**
- WeatherInterpolation.InterpolateForLocation()
- WeatherInterpolation.InterpolateTemporally()

**Probability:** Low (1)  
- Implementation uses industry-standard inverse distance weighting
- 1km grid resolution from Met.no is sufficient for city-scale
- Tests validate interpolation accuracy

**Impact:** Low (1)  
- Minor inaccuracies in weather predictions
- Users are accustomed to weather uncertainty

**Mitigation Strategy:**
 **Implemented:**
- Well-tested interpolation algorithms (15 tests)
- Confidence level reduces for interpolated data
- Graceful fallback to nearest neighbor when grid points are sparse

**Future Enhancement:**
- Consider more sophisticated interpolation (kriging) if accuracy issues are reported

**Residual Risk:** Minimal - Acceptable for MVP  
**Owner:** dev  
**Timeline:** Post-MVP enhancement if needed

### BUS-001: Weather Prediction Accuracy
**Category:** Business  
**Risk Score:** 1 (Low Probability  Low Impact)

**Description:**  
Weather forecasts may be inaccurate, leading to incorrect sun predictions even with perfect processing.

**Affected Components:**
- External weather APIs (Met.no, OpenWeatherMap)
- Sun prediction business logic

**Probability:** Low (1)  
- Both APIs are industry-standard with good accuracy
- Confidence levels communicate uncertainty to users

**Impact:** Low (1)  
- Users understand weather forecasts are imperfect
- Confidence levels set expectations

**Mitigation Strategy:**
 **Accepted:**
- This is an inherent limitation of weather forecasting
- Confidence level calculation helps communicate uncertainty
- Using multiple sources (Met.no + OpenWeatherMap) improves reliability

**Residual Risk:** Accepted as business reality  
**Owner:** po  
**Timeline:** N/A - inherent to domain
