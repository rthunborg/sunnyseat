## Detailed Risk Assessment

### TEST-001: Test Infrastructure Not Installed
**Category:** Testing  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Probability:** High (3/3) - Tests are documented but cannot execute  
**Impact:** Medium (2/3) - Blocks production deployment but not feature development  
**Risk Score:** 6/9

**Description:**
All component test cases are thoroughly documented with excellent coverage specifications, but the test infrastructure (Vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, jsdom) is not installed or configured. Tests cannot be executed to verify component behavior.

**Evidence:**
- Test documentation files exist for all 5 components
- Comprehensive test cases documented following Given-When-Then pattern
- No package.json dependencies for testing libraries
- No vitest configuration in vite.config.ts

**Impact Analysis:**
- Cannot verify component behavior programmatically
- Risk of regression when components are modified
- Cannot achieve >80% coverage target
- Blocks production deployment per testing standards

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Install required dependencies: 
pm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @vitest/ui jsdom
2. Configure vitest in vite.config.ts
3. Execute all documented test cases
4. Verify >80% coverage target met
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Owner:** Dev team  
**Timeline:** Before production deployment

### PERF-001: Components Not Memoized
**Category:** Performance  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Probability:** Medium (2/3) - Will cause re-renders with large datasets  
**Impact:** Low (1/3) - Acceptable for current scale, optimization opportunity  
**Risk Score:** 3/9 (formerly 2/9, adjusted)

**Description:**
PatioCard, MiniTimeline, and ConfidenceBadge components are not wrapped in React.memo, which could cause unnecessary re-renders when the parent PatioList updates (e.g., when user scrolls, filters, or new data arrives).

**Evidence:**
- Components are functional but not memoized
- PatioList renders up to 20 cards initially with "Load More" pagination
- No performance profiling data available

**Impact Analysis:**
- Acceptable performance for current scale (<100 patios)
- May cause sluggishness with >50 patios in list
- Could impact mobile device performance
- Frontend performance target: <2s p50 initial load (currently estimated <1s)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Profile actual performance with realistic data (50-100 patios)
2. If issues detected, add React.memo to:
   - PatioCard (most frequently rendered)
   - MiniTimeline (contains 12 child elements)
   - ConfidenceBadge (simple component, low priority)
3. Consider useCallback for event handlers if needed

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Owner:** Dev team (optional enhancement)  
**Timeline:** Future iteration if performance issues arise

### INT-001: API Endpoint May Not Exist
**Category:** Integration  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Probability:** Medium (2/3) - Referenced in hook but not confirmed  
**Impact:** Low (1/3) - Hook may be unused if data comes from main endpoint  
**Risk Score:** 3/9 (formerly 2/9, adjusted)

**Description:**
The useMiniTimeline hook references endpoint /api/patios/{id}/timeline for fetching timeline data separately, but the story documentation indicates miniTimeline data is included in the main /api/patios response. The endpoint may not exist or may be unnecessary.

**Evidence:**
- useMiniTimeline.ts line 51: etch(/api/patios//timeline...)
- Story notes: "Mini timeline data is included in the /api/patios response under the miniTimeline field"
- No API documentation confirms endpoint existence

**Impact Analysis:**
- If endpoint doesn't exist, hook will fail when called
- Main functionality may work if timeline data comes from primary endpoint
- Could cause console errors or failed requests
- Story implementation may not use the hook (timeline data passed as prop)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Verify if /api/patios/{id}/timeline endpoint exists in backend
2. If not, either:
   - Remove unused hook, or
   - Update hook to use main /api/patios endpoint, or
   - Implement backend endpoint for separate timeline fetching
3. Clarify when hook vs. prop-based timeline data should be used

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour  
**Owner:** Dev team  
**Timeline:** Next sprint or as needed

### TEST-002: Integration Tests Not Specified
**Category:** Testing  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Probability:** Low (1/3) - Unit tests may provide sufficient coverage  
**Impact:** Low (2/3) - Missing validation of component interactions  
**Risk Score:** 2/9

**Description:**
Only unit test documentation exists for individual components. Integration tests for component interactions (PatioList + PatioCard + EmptyState, etc.) are not specified.

**Evidence:**
- Test documentation covers unit-level behavior
- No integration test specifications found
- Component interactions are well-defined but not formally tested

**Impact Analysis:**
- Unit tests may catch most issues
- Could miss interaction bugs (e.g., PatioList not properly passing data to PatioCard)
- Manual testing can verify interactions for current scope
- Lower risk given simple component hierarchy

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Add integration test suite for key workflows:
   - PatioList renders multiple PatioCards correctly
   - EmptyState displays when <3 sunny patios
   - GeofenceWarning appears on appropriate cards
   - Click handlers propagate correctly
2. Consider E2E tests for full user journey in later sprint

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Owner:** Dev team (future enhancement)  
**Timeline:** Future iteration
