# Risk Profile: Story 1.6 - CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Reviewed By:** Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Story:** 1.6 - CI/CD Pipeline Setup  
**Gate Status:** FAIL

## Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH (Score: 7/10)

This story has strong technical implementation but **critical operational documentation gaps** that create medium-high risk for team productivity, onboarding, and troubleshooting effectiveness. The CI/CD workflows themselves are production-ready, but the missing documentation deliverables violate the story's explicit Definition of Done.

## Risk Matrix

**Scoring:** Probability (1-5) × Impact (1-10) ÷ 2 = Risk Score (1-10)

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### R1: Missing Operational Documentation (HIGH RISK - Score: 7)

**Description:**  
Three critical documentation deliverables explicitly required by the story are missing:

- Repository-level `README.md` with build badge
- `docs/ops/ci-cd-guide.md` with pipeline architecture and usage
- `docs/ops/ci-cd-troubleshooting.md` with common failure scenarios

**Impact:**

- New team members cannot quickly understand or use the CI/CD pipeline
- Troubleshooting failures requires deep workflow YAML diving
- No centralized knowledge base for CI/CD operations
- Onboarding friction and lost productivity
- Violates story's Definition of Done (blocking acceptance)

**Likelihood:** Certain (5/5) - Documentation definitively does not exist

**Mitigation:**

1. Create `README.md` in repository root with build badge, quick start, tech stack overview
2. Create `docs/ops/ci-cd-guide.md` with comprehensive pipeline documentation
3. Create `docs/ops/ci-cd-troubleshooting.md` with failure scenarios and solutions
4. Include workflow diagrams showing build → test → deploy flow
5. Document branch strategy and environment promotion process

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### R2: Code Coverage Reporting Not Configured (MEDIUM RISK - Score: 6)

**Description:**  
The story explicitly requires code coverage reporting with >80% target. While tests execute in CI, no coverage collection or reporting is configured.

**Impact:**

- Cannot track code quality metrics over time
- No visibility into test coverage trends
- Missing quality gate that story explicitly requires
- Technical debt may accumulate undetected
- Violates acceptance criteria

**Likelihood:** Certain (5/5) - Coverage collection is not present in workflows

**Mitigation:**

1. Add `coverlet.collector` NuGet package to test projects
2. Modify `build-and-test.yml` to collect coverage: `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
3. Integrate Codecov, Coveralls, or Azure DevOps coverage visualization
4. Add coverage badge to README
5. Set quality gate to fail if coverage drops below threshold

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Example Implementation:**

```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: dotnet test --no-build --configuration Release --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory ./coverage

- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    directory: ./coverage
    fail_ci_if_error: false
```

---

### R3: Integration Test Failures (MEDIUM RISK - Score: 5)

**Description:**  
Two integration tests are currently failing with HTTP 503 errors:

- `FullSystemIntegrationTests.CompleteSystem_WhenStarted_ShouldBeHealthy()`
- `FullSystemIntegrationTests.API_HealthEndpoint_ShouldRespondQuickly()`

Both expect HTTP 200 but receive HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable).

**Impact:**

- CI pipeline may be showing false negatives
- Health check validation not working in test environment
- Service dependency issues may go undetected
- Cannot verify end-to-end system health in automated tests

**Likelihood:** Certain (5/5) - Tests are currently failing

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**

- Tests may be running before services (PostgreSQL, Redis) are fully ready
- Health check dependencies not properly configured in test environment
- Tests may be designed for local development environment, not CI

**Mitigation:**

1. Investigate why health endpoints return 503 in test environment
2. Ensure `build-and-test.yml` properly waits for service dependencies
3. Verify health check implementation in `Program.cs`
4. Consider separating health check integration tests into distinct test category
5. Add service readiness checks before running integration tests

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours investigation + fixes

### R4: Docker vs Web App Deployment Mismatch (LOW RISK - Score: 3)

**Description:**  
Story's technical implementation section proposes Docker containerization with GHCR/ACR deployment, but actual implementation uses `dotnet publish` → Azure Web App deployment.

**Impact:**

- Documentation doesn't match implementation
- Potential confusion for team members
- May indicate incomplete story implementation OR valid architecture pivot

**Likelihood:** Likely (3/5) - Mismatch exists but may be intentional decision

**Assessment:**  
This appears to be an **acceptable architecture variation**. Azure Web Apps is a valid deployment target and may have been chosen for:

- Simpler deployment process
- Lower infrastructure management overhead
- Cost optimization
- Faster time-to-market

**Mitigation (Choose One):**

**Option A - Accept Current Implementation (Recommended):**

1. Update story documentation to reflect Azure Web App deployment
2. Remove Docker build job specification from technical implementation section
3. Document rationale for Web App choice in architecture decisions
4. Update deployment sections to match actual `deploy-staging.yml` and `deploy-production.yml`

**Option B - Implement Docker Containerization:**

1. Create Dockerfile for API project
2. Add Docker build job to workflow as specified in story
3. Push images to GHCR or ACR
4. Update deployment to use container images
5. Modify Azure infrastructure to use Container Apps instead of Web Apps

**Recommendation:** Option A - Current implementation is production-ready and follows Azure best practices. Docker containerization can be added later if needed.

## Risk Trend Analysis

**Current Trajectory:** IMPROVING (once documentation is added)

The CI/CD implementation itself is **excellent** - professional-grade DevOps with comprehensive coverage of build, test, security, and deployment. The risks are entirely in **documentation and configuration gaps**, not fundamental technical issues.

**Timeline to Resolution:**

- **Documentation (R1):** 4-6 hours → Eliminates HIGH risk
- **Code Coverage (R2):** 2-3 hours → Eliminates MEDIUM risk
- **Test Failures (R3):** 1-2 hours → Eliminates MEDIUM risk
- **Total Effort:** 7-11 hours to reach PASS state

**After Mitigation:**  
Risk level would drop to **LOW** with all acceptance criteria met and a production-grade CI/CD pipeline fully documented.

## Recommendations by Priority

### IMMEDIATE (Must Fix Before Done)

1. **Create Missing Documentation** (Addresses R1 - HIGH)

   - `README.md` with build badge and quick start
   - `docs/ops/ci-cd-guide.md` with pipeline architecture
   - `docs/ops/ci-cd-troubleshooting.md` with failure scenarios

2. **Configure Code Coverage** (Addresses R2 - MEDIUM)

   - Add coverlet.collector
   - Collect coverage in workflow
   - Integrate reporting tool

3. **Fix Integration Tests** (Addresses R3 - MEDIUM)
   - Investigate 503 errors
   - Ensure service dependencies ready
   - Categorize tests appropriately

### RECOMMENDED (Near-term Improvements)

4. **Align Documentation with Implementation** (Addresses R4 - LOW)

   - Update story to reflect Web App deployment OR implement Docker

5. **Add Development Environment Deployment**

   - Create workflow for `develop` → dev environment (if needed)

6. **Enhance Security Scanning**
   - Add SAST with CodeQL
   - Configure Dependabot for dependency updates

| **Artifact Management**   | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Caching works, Docker not implemented (acceptable) |
| **Deployment Automation** | ✅ PASS    | Multi-environment with approval gates              |
| **Documentation**         | ❌ FAIL    | All three required docs missing                    |

---

## Conclusion

This story demonstrates **strong DevOps engineering** with production-ready workflows, but **fails to meet its Definition of Done** due to critical documentation gaps. The technical implementation receives high marks, but operational documentation is a story requirement, not optional.

**Gate Decision: FAIL** until documentation is created and code coverage is configured.

**Estimated Time to PASS:** 7-11 hours of focused work to complete documentation and coverage configuration.

Once these gaps are addressed, this will be an **exemplary CI/CD implementation** that sets a strong foundation for the project's development workflow.
