4. After fixes, retry QA review

### Problem: Story Status Unclear

**Solution:**

1. Use Pattern 3 (Status Verification)
2. Have @dev investigate actual code state
3. Update documentation to match reality

### Problem: Agent Doesn't Understand Request

**Solution:**

1. Be more specific about which story file to work on
2. Include the full story file content
