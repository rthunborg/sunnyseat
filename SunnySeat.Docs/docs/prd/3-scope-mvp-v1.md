# 3. Scope — MVP (V1)
## Must‑Have (In Scope)
1. **Admin tooling** to draw/import **patio polygons** per venue (manual mapping).  
2. **Data model** for venues, patios, orientation, optional height hints.  
3. **Solar + shadow engine (2.5D)** using building footprints + heights (heuristics floors→meters when missing).  
4. **Now / next 2–4 hours** sunlight status per patio with **confidence %** (cloud cover via public API nowcast/forecast).  
5. **Public map + list** with basic filters (distance, district, price level).  
6. **SEO’d venue page** (shareable deep link).  

## Out of Scope (Later)
Notifications, favorites, routing/ETA, multi‑city, ML polygon detection, bookings/loyalty.
